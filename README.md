# fivem-nodemon THIS IS NOT A SCRIPT THIS IS A DEVTOOL

for using you need to use /autorestart

nodemon-like for fivem when a resource file changes detects it and restart that resource

# for "geeks" like me:
the system is really basic actually all i do is created a 1 min loop and in every loop i check all the files in the server and hashed it with "sha1" and store the hashes in a array so when a file changed it its hash also changed i compare the old hash and new hash if they are diffrent the script is restarted with new changes so you dont need to restart manually
